# the first field or  a = 1  declairing a variable and setting it equal to 1
# the second field or a = <11 this is telling the for loop to execute a do block as long as our variable turns up less than 11 
# I want you to print out this text and print the number we are on then do it again until the var 'i' turns up 11 or greater.
